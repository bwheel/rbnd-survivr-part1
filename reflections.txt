Metaprogramming
The colorizr gem takes advantage of Ruby's metaprogramming in one way; the creation 
of the color functions. The library has a hash table of color names and associated 
codes. Inside the create_colors method the hash table is looped over and a instance 
method is created for each key, which happens to be the color/method name).

Project duration
I probably spent 3-4 days, but no more than 2 hours each day. It was 4 hours total.  

Challenge
The most challenging part was the metaprogramming. There are several ways to do it 
and it was hard to pick the correct way, and not mix between them.

Growth
I still need practice with metaprogramming. Conceptually I get it, but it is still
pretty difficult to implement.
